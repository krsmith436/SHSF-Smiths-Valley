# SHSF-Smiths-Valley
 This sketch is part of a DC control system for the Smith, Huotari & Santa Fe (SHSF) HO scale model railroad.
 
  ## Smiths Valley controls the following elements of railroad:
  1) 16 Tortoise Slow Motion Switch Machine
      NOTE: Unique feature is the motor can remain powered after movement so no need to turn off.
  2) 8 Blocks with A or B cab control
  3) Sound
  4) Use Built-in LED for Fault Indication
  
  ## Hardware used:
  1) Arduino Nano Clone from Dr. Duino Model Railroad Explorer Edition
  2) MLT-BT05 Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) module with chip (CC2540/CC2541)
  3) 74HC595 Serial to Parallel Shift Register
  CODE:https://github.com/janisrove/Arduino-74HC595-shift-registers/blob/master/ArduinoLEDsWithShiftRegisters/ArduinoLEDsWithShiftRegisters.ino
  4) CD4041 Inverter
  5) DFPlayer Mini Module (MP3 player)
  6) Addressable LEDs for block indication
